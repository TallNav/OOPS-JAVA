Learnings of Interfaces : 

ðŸ”¹30.05.25 : Learned about interfaces with examples and implementations
    
1. Implemented a smarthomecontroller example where an interface  - controllable was established
 . It had the methods of turnon, turnoff and status.
2. Firstly I create classes fan , light and so and implemented the interface and then made use of the methods provided. 
3. Next created a list and then looped the methods of off and on 
4. Then created another class smartHomeController that enabled addition of new devices (but it must be already 
instantiated/ be an object). 
5. Now this class creation enable me to simultaneously switch on and off all the objects / appliances:)
